    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <strong>POOLISH:</strong> 
    <ul>
        <li>300 ml Lukewarm Water</li>
        <li>5 g Dry Yeast</li>
        <li>5 g Honey</li>
        <li>300 g 00 Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>DOUGH:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>700 ml Lukewarm Water</li>
        <li>40 g Salt</li>
        <li>1,250 g 00 Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <strong>POOLISH:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together all ingredients</li>
        <li>Cover and set at room temperature for 1-hour</li>
        <li>After rest place overnight in fridge</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>DOUGH:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Together with water in a large bowl, add the Poolish, 1/2 flour and all of the salt</li>
        <li>Mix well, add remaining flour to bowl and mix all well---dough will be sticky but together.</li>
        <li>Hand knead for 5-10 mins; cover with bowl and let rest for 15-mins.</li>
        <li>Remove bowl and keeping top on top always, using bench scraper work dough with hands kinda like a big ball, with fingers underneath lifting dough off board, repeat.</li>
        <li>Coat a little olive oil in mixing bowl then gently place dough in bowl; allow to rest/rise for 1-hour with cover.</li>
        <li>Remove dough onto work board; coat your hands with olive oil and pat on top of the dough.</li>
        <li>Make 3 equal cuts across the dough. Take one end and shape ball with one hand, cut dough with other.</li>
        <li>This method makes nice round balls.</li>
        <li>Coat a sheet pan with Semolina flour and place dough balls about 2-3 fingers apart; little oil on top dough balls and cover with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Rest at room temp for 2-hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Notes:</strong>
    <p>I ALWAYS use my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer vs. hand-kneading. My dough comes out perfect every time. </p>
